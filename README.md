Used a parameterizable VLIW soft-core processor (VEX) to determine a suitable architecture
for running four benchmark C programs. Conducted extensive Design Space Exploration
over a very large search space to obtain the most efficient processor design with a 
trade-off between performance, area utilization and power consumed by using Simulated Annealing.
